-Fixed bug in ZXing-formatted QRCodes that was causing crashes
-Fixed bugs which caused flaky attention to selected SharedPreferences
-Added Gallery support for shared scans(Doesn't entirely work yet, the code is there, it's just not all hooked up yet)
-Moved basic Wifi-handling code into separate method away from barcode parsing
-Added NyalaLib class as a home for non-UI/non-Wifi support classes/methods
-Added "disconnect" button state for when Nyala is launched already connected to one network
 (This is mostly a testing use-case, but it might be useful for others)
-Main picture now changes to the barcode you just scanned after a successful connect
 (Maybe this should be a check-able feature?)
-A bunch of other stuff I can't remember ATM

12/30/11
-Added support for the ZXing format of QREncoded WLAN info along the existing Nyala format.
-Added some basic parsing/validation code to sanitize data being scanned in

12/27/11
-Added an "About" screen
-Added "Share" feature so that you can now share the last code you scanned w/ a friend. 
-Added (but haven't hooked up) a parsing/validator class to sanitize decoded strings. 
-If you are already connected to an AP, Nyala notices this and gives you the option to stay connected
 to the current one or disconnect(with the assumption you're going to scan and connect to another AP).
