-Fixed another ZXing parsing bug with different QRCode generators not using the same terminating char sequence
 specified in the ZXing docs and the QRCode generator on their website (But which Barcode Scanner happily eats). 
 Thanks Kai MacTane <digitalsidhe@silmemar.org> for providing the barcode that brought this bug to the surface.

-Fixed a bug which could cause duplicate entries of an AP to be added to the list of available APs after 
 scanning. 
-Did some work on NyalaLib: Added a few factory methods for UI and filesystem stuff. Refactored large chunks of the
 barcode history/last-scan-saving code. The basic story here is that custom paths on SDcards are futzy on non-rooted
phones across different vendors/carriers. Sometimes they work,sometimes you get "permission denied". 
I'd rather not promise what I can't deliver, so custom paths had to go. So you can either save scanned barcodes
 to the Internal App Data dir or to /mnt/sdcard.  There MAY be a way around this, but
TBPH, I have bigger features to fry. If you REALLY want this, well, you're in the source tree for this project,
you should know what to do. 
-Gallery support is still being fleshed out. It shouldn't crash, but probably doesn't do much beyond that ATM

-Fixed bug in ZXing-formatted QRCodes that was causing crashes
-Fixed bugs which caused flaky attention to selected SharedPreferences
-Added Gallery support for shared scans(Doesn't entirely work yet, the code is there, it's just not all hooked up yet)
-Moved basic Wifi-handling code into separate method away from barcode parsing
-Added NyalaLib class as a home for non-UI/non-Wifi support classes/methods
-Added "disconnect" button state for when Nyala is launched already connected to one network
 (This is mostly a testing use-case, but it might be useful for others)
-Main picture now changes to the barcode you just scanned after a successful connect
 (Maybe this should be a check-able feature?)
-A bunch of other stuff I can't remember ATM

12/30/11
-Added support for the ZXing format of QREncoded WLAN info along the existing Nyala format.
-Added some basic parsing/validation code to sanitize data being scanned in

12/27/11
-Added an "About" screen
-Added "Share" feature so that you can now share the last code you scanned w/ a friend. 
-Added (but haven't hooked up) a parsing/validator class to sanitize decoded strings. 
-If you are already connected to an AP, Nyala notices this and gives you the option to stay connected
 to the current one or disconnect(with the assumption you're going to scan and connect to another AP).

I figured it might be good to start running a CHANGES file here.

12/20/11 
-Fixed a bug where I was unregistering from the WifiStatusReceiver too many times which
would sometimes cause a crash when exiting the app. 

11/26/11
-added more layout files for large-screen devices like tablets
-added Settings Activity to provide basic options like auto-connect and auto-exit.

3/10/11
-Initial prototype version.
