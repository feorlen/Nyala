Like the CHANGES file, but keeps track of features/functionality.

Current Feature set:
Auto-connect. If this is checked, Nyala will automatically attempt to connect to the SSID embedded in the QRCode
it just scanned. 
Auto-exit. If this is checked, Nyala will automatically exit upon successfully connecting to the wireless network.
