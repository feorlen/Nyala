Nyala is an Android app for allowing handheld devices to get on wireless networks without having to type in 
a password. It uses the ZXing API for scanning in a QRCode which contains data like the SSID, BSSID, PSK, etc. 
needed to get onto the access point encoded in that QRCode.  

For the average user typing in the password for a WLAN they're in range of and want to connect to can be
pretty frustrating what with soft keyboards and all. We're hoping that people will start encoding their 
WLAN PSKs as barcodes as well as human-readable text to make it easier for mobile devices to get on the network. 

Nyala currently supports 2 formats for encoding WLAN data. 
1. "Nyala format" <SSID>::<BSSID>::<PSK>:: (Nyala only supports WPA/WPA2 PSKs, no WEP, so there's no need for a type field)
2. "ZXing format" WIFI:T:<KEYTYPE>;S:<SSID>;P:<PSK>;;

Note the trailing characters at the end of each format. These are required.

Nyala is a fairly straightforward app from an Android SDK perspective and has been found to work with a number of Android 
phones and tablets running Android 3.x and 2.x:
G1 Dev phone
HTC G2
HTC EVO 4G
Motorola Droid
Motorola Xoom 10.1 Tablet
Huawei IDEOS
