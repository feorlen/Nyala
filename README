Nyala is an Android app for allowing handheld devices to get on wireless networks without having to type in 
a password. It uses the ZXing API for scanning in a QRCode and then using the decoded text contained in the
barcode as the SSID, PSK, etc. needed to get onto the local network. 

For the average user typing in the password for a WLAN they're in range of and want to connect to can be
pretty frustrating what with soft keyboards and all. We're hoping that people will start encoding their 
WLAN PSKs as barcodes as well as human-readable text to make it easier for mobile devices to get on the network.
